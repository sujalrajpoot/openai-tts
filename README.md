## 🛠️ Installation

**Using pip command**
```bash
pip install openai-tts
```

**Clone Locally**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/openai-tts.git
cd openai-tts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- requests

## 📋 Quick Start

```python
from openai_tts import OpenaiTTS
from openai_tts.config import VoiceType

# Initialize the TTS engine
tts = OpenaiTTS()

# Generate speech with default settings
text = "Hello world! This is a demonstration of the OpenAI TTS library."
tts.speak(text)  # Saves to default "output.mp3"

# Try different voices
tts.speak(text, voice=VoiceType.ECHO, output_path="echo_voice.mp3")
tts.speak(text, voice=VoiceType.NOVA, output_path="nova_voice.mp3")

# Control verbosity
tts.speak(text, verbose=False, output_path="quiet_output.mp3")
```

## 🎯 How It Works

The OpenAI TTS Library operates through a series of sophisticated steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is divided into natural sentences using our custom SentenceTokenizer, ensuring that the generated speech will sound natural with appropriate pauses.

2. **Parallel Processing**: Each sentence is processed concurrently using a thread pool, maximizing efficiency especially for longer texts.

3. **API Interaction**: The library communicates with OpenAI's TTS API, handling authentication, request formatting, and response processing.

4. **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and error handling ensure reliability even when network issues occur.

5. **Output Generation**: The audio chunks are assembled in the correct order and saved to the specified output file.

## 🌟 Voice Options

Choose from a variety of voice options:

| ALLOY | ASH | BALLAD | CORAL | ECHO | FABLE | ONYX | NOVA | SAGE | SHIMMER | VERSE |

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```python
from openai_tts import OpenaiTTS, TTSConfig
from openai_tts.config import VoiceType

# Create custom configuration
config = TTSConfig(
    timeout=30,  # Increase timeout to 30 seconds
    verbose=True,  # Print detailed progress
    output_path="custom.mp3",  # Default output path
    voice=VoiceType.NOVA  # Default voice
)

# Initialize with custom config
tts = OpenaiTTS(config=config)

# Use the configured TTS
tts.speak("This text will be converted using the custom configuration.")

# Override specific settings for a single call
tts.speak(
    "This will use different settings just for this call.",
    voice=VoiceType.ECHO,
    output_path="override.mp3"
)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from openai_tts import OpenaiTTS
from openai_tts.exceptions import TTSException

tts = OpenaiTTS()

try:
    tts.speak("This is a test of error handling.")
except TTSException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

The library is designed to handle large text inputs efficiently through parallel processing. However, very large texts may still take considerable time to process due to API rate limits and processing requirements.

For optimal performance:
- Split very large texts into reasonable chunks before processing
- Consider running resource-intensive operations in a background process
- Use the `verbose=True` option to monitor progress during long operations

## 🔒 Security

This library communicates with external services. Always be mindful of:
- The content you're sending to the API
- Where you're storing the generated audio files
- Who has access to your implementation

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🎙️ **Content Creation**: Generate voiceovers for videos, podcasts, or presentations
- 📚 **Accessibility**: Convert written content to audio for accessibility purposes
- 🤖 **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Give your applications a voice
- 🎮 **Gaming**: Create dynamic dialogue for game characters
- 📱 **Mobile Apps**: Add speech capabilities to your applications
